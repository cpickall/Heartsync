# heartsync
Double heart monitor tests whether two people's heartbeats come into sync. Build on Arduino.

Heartsync is a device that allows two people to feel each other's heartbeats. Each person wears a pulse sensor that captures their heartbeat and a wristband containing a vibration motor that transmits their partner's heartbeat as a pulse against their wrist. If the two heartbeats come into sync, the box in the center lights up. 

Built using <a href="http://pulsesensor.com/">this heartbeat sensor.</a>
